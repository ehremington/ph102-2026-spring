# Weekly Introduction and Notes

## Week 1

### Intro

The next three weeks we will be covering the subject of heat, which fits into the broader category known as *Thermodynamics*. Thermodynamics is really just the study of large numbers of particles, such as the air in a tire or the molecules in a cube of ice. There are so many that we couldn't keep track of the motion of all of them even if we wanted to. Recall that last semester we really only learned about how to deal with *one or two* objects at a time, using Newton's third law and the conservation of momentum. We know that the conservation of energy is a broad law, but how do we apply it to so many particles? And are there other laws that govern the state of so many particles at once?

The end goal of these weeks is to understand the basic principles of how an engine works. All engines take energy in the form of heat and use that to do some kind of work (drive a car or train, power a generator to produce electricity, operate some kind of tool).

To start this subject we will spend this week just learning how to describe such a system, and this will lead us to the perhaps familiar *Ideal Gas Law*. So the goal at the end of this week is that you can

- define temperature and use the various common temperature scales
- discuss the topic of thermal equilibrium
- apply the formula for thermal expansion to interesting problems
- discuss and use the quantities of number, mass, volume, density, moles, molar mass, and pressure
- use the ideal gas law to solve interesting problems

Reading Chapter 13 sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

## Week 2

### Intro

The key idea this week is about *heat* and how heat is a transfer of energy, like work was in physics 1. Heat is not temperature, since temperature is related to the internal energy of an object. The higher the temperature, the more energy each atom or molecule that makes up the substance has. But heat is a transfer of that energy to another object. That flow of heat from one object to another may result in the temperature of the second object increasing, since heat always flows spontaneously from an hotter object (higher temp) to a cooler object (lower temp). So what we want to study this week is how much heat does it take to change the temperature of a substance. It turns out this will depend of several factors, such as how much substance is being heated, what atoms or molecules it consists of, and what state of matter the substance is in (solid, liquid, gas). We will also cover how much heat is required to change the state of the substance, from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.

So after this week you can

- define heat and differentiate it from energy and temperature.
- use the heat capacity and specific heats to solve interesting problems involving changes in temperature.
- use the latent heat to solve problems how much energy is required to change phase.

Reading for this week will be sections 1-5 of Chapter 14.

## Week 3

### Intro

This week we introduce how to do work on a gas or how a gas can do work on its surroundings. This will always involve either an compression of the gas or an expansion of the gas. Doing work to a gas is a way of adding energy to the gas, so that we now have two ways of changing the internal energy of a gas: heat and work. We now have that the internal energy of a gas can only be changed by the external factors, and this First Law of Thermodynamics is really just a restatement of the conservation of energy. There are many different combinations of work done and heat added to a gas at the same time but we will look at some special cases. The key insight after studying some of the possibilities will be that we can combine processes in such a way that we make a thermodynamic cycle, which means that after a series of adding or removing heat and doing or receiving work, the gas can return to its initial state, but we will see that, *on net,* work has been done on the surroundings. This clever cycle is the basis of all heat engines from steam engines and turbines to gasoline and diesel engines. All of these heat engines have limits to their *efficiency* and we will study some cases of this. Finally the reversal of this process will yield an air conditioner and a heat pump, which are common appliances to all of us.

So after this week you can

- determine the work done on or by a gas
- calculate the change in energy, heat added/removed and work done in various important thermodynamic processes
- calculate the net work done on the surroundings by a thermodynamic cycle
- determine the efficiency of an engine
- discuss and distinguish the functioning of an engine, a heat pump, and an air conditioner
- discuss the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which we have already talked about but haven't named yet.)

Reading suggestions this week are sections 1-6 of Chapter 15. We will talk about the quantity of entropy in class briefly but will not include it in any calculations.

## Week 4

### Intro

This week we begin our study of a new branch of physics: Electricity and Magnetism. These phenomena are linked together, although our study of them will consider each separately. This week we will discuss the fundamental property of *charge* that some matter possesses and the fact that that charge produces an *electric force field* all around it. This force field in turn exerts a force on other charges that are with in it. Remember back to Newton's Third Law that forces always occur in pairs. These charges will exert an equal and opposite force on each other by their electric fields. We will see that on the microscopic level, charge is most often from protons and electrons within the atoms that make up matter, but that from the macroscopic level the material appears neutral since there are roughly as many protons as electrons *on net*. But we can force electrons to move en mass and from this we can get different charge distributions that give rise to large electric fields of different shapes. In addition to the electric field that arises from a point charge, we will consider the conditions that give rise to a uniform electric field, since this will allow us to use constant forces and constant accelerations to describe the motion of charged particles within these fields.

After this week you can:

- discuss charge and the role of charge in the composition of matter
- determine the electric field strength due to multiple charge configurations
- determine the force on a point charge within an electric field
- use the special case of a constant electric field to analyze the motion of a charged particle within it

Reading suggestions for this week are sections 3, 4, and 5, and the first part of section 1 from chapter 16.

## Week 5
### Intro

This week we are going to build upon the understanding of electric force and electric field from last week and consider the amount of work that its takes to move charges around. The work that an external agent does to move charges around in a system is equal to the change in the potential energy of the system. So we will once again use the principle of conservation of energy to discuss the motion of charges within an electric field. We do this primarily because the electric forces are often not constant (except for the sheet charge distribution) and this means that using conservation of energy is much easier to work with. In doing this we will study a new quantity called *electric potential* which is a confusing name because it is not the same thing as electric potential energy. Electric potential is the work *per unit of charge* or the change in potential energy *per unit of charge* that is being carried around in an electric field. Electric potential is also known as *voltage*. Finally we will discuss how a capacitor can be used to store electric potential energy, and figure out how much it can store.

After this week you can,

- discuss the meaning of electric potential also known as voltage.
- use the conservation of energy to solve interesting problems involving the motion of charges in an electric field.
- use the relationship between electric field and voltage to get a picture of what the universe looks like from the perspective of a charge.
- use the physical properties of a capacitor to find how much energy it can store.

Reading suggestions for this week include sections 1-5 and section 7 of chapter 17.


## Week 6

### Intro

This week we will apply our knowledge of voltage and its effect on the energy of charged particles. If particles are given potential energy and a pathway to move through, then they will move from high potential energy to low potential energy. This movement of particles *en masse* is called *current*. The current depends on the voltage along the pathway and the resistance to flow along the pathway. The pathway could in principle be through any material, but we will focus on a circuit consisting of metallic wires that connect a source of voltage to an output of energy (like a light bulb or a motor). The resistance to current flow is present in all metals, but depends on the shape of the wire (its length and cross sectional area) and the material that the wire is made of. Any device that is in the circuit can be conceptualized as an ideal resistance in the circuit that we call a resistor. We will study simple circuits at networks of resistors to find how much current flows with resistors connected in different ways. Finally we will look at how much power an energy source can deliver and how that can be used by various devices.

After this week you can

- discuss circuits and understand a simple wiring diagram
- solve interesting problems involving multiple resistances
- discuss power use in circuits
- describe the use of electrical circuits in the home

Reading suggestions for this week include sections sections 1 - 6 of chapter 18, but not the part of chapter 6 about capacitors.

## Week 7

### Intro

This week we will take a closer look at another common element in circuits: the capacitor. We have reviewed some properties of a capacitor before, but now we will consider their role as energy storage devices and how combinations of them behave in a circuit. We since all circuits with capacitors possess at least some resistance, we will also investigate circuits with resistors and capacitors in them and see how the current flow will now change over time as the capacitor charges up or discharges.

After this week you can:

- discuss capacitors and how to make them
- use the physical properties of a capacitor to find how much energy it can store.
- combine capacitors in series and in parallel and find the equivalent capacitance
- use the RC circuit to determine current flow and voltage across a capacitor over time as it discharges

Reading suggestions for this week include section 7 of chapter 17, the second have of section 6 in chapter 18 about capacitors, and section 10 of chapter 18.

## Week 8

Mid-Semester Review and Exam

## Week 9

### Intro

This week we will learn about the last force field that we will cover this year: the magnetic force field. The magnetic field arises from *charges in motion* aka current and exerts a magnetic force on other charges in motion within the field. This week we will focus on the production of magnetic fields and next week we will focus on the effect of those fields on other charges. The magnetic field depends not only on the current and the distance away from the current but also on how that current is shaped. The currents we will look at are a line of current and a loop of current. The trickiest aspect of describing the magnetic field is its *direction*. The magnetic field always points in a three dimensional way from the direction of the current and the direction to the point away from that current where you want to know the magnetic field. This will involve using a memory trick called the *right hand rule* that we will use several times over the next few weeks.

After this week you can:

- describe the magnetic field in terms of its magnitude resulting from a current
- employ the right hand rule to describe the direction of a magnetic field around a current
- discuss the everyday phenomena of magnetism both from the earth and from common magnetic materials.

I present this material in a backwards order from the way the book presents it, but you should still read sections 1, 8, and 10 from chapter 19.

## Week 10

### Intro

This week we are going to look at the force that results from the magnetic field acting on other currents and moving charges. We will encounter another instance of the right hand rule that will relate the direction of moving charges (direction of your wrist), the direction of the magnetic field they are in (curl your fingers toward the field), and the direction of the force (your thumb). Particles moving in a magnetic field are naturally driven into circular paths, which means the magnetic force will act as the radial net force, and produce uniform circular motion. We will apply this to understand mass spectroscopy as well as proton cyclotrons that are used for treating cancer. Finally, we will see that the magnetic force will exert a torque on a current loop, and cause it to rotate, and by cleverly controlling the current, we can cause the dipole to keep rotating. This is the basis of an electric motor.

After this week you can

- discuss the magnetic force
- discuss the function of mass spectroscopy and cyclotrons
- discuss the function of an electric motor

Reading suggestions for this week include sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of chapter 19.


## Week 11

### Intro

Now that we have talked in detail about both the electric and magnetic fields, we will consider the case of *oscillations* of these fields. That means the electric field at a certain place will point up and then behind that place it will point down, and then behind that place up again, and so on. This pattern will itself move through space to form a *wave*. A magnetic field will be set up perpendicularly to the electric field and move with it, and together they form an *electromagnetic wave*. This wave radiates (moves) through space and can exist at many different wavelengths (for frequencies) and the way it interacts with matter differs for different frequencies. We we a portion of this electromagnetic spectrum as *visible light* but we use different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for communication, radiant heat, or imaging. Electromagnetic radiation in the *ultraviolet* range gives us sunburn, and in the X-ray range passes through everything in our bodies except our bones. Gamma ray radiation can both cause cancer and be an effective treatment for cancer. The speed of these waves depends on the material they are passing through, but in a vacuum, this speed of light is one of the most important quantities in all of physics. The *index of refraction* of a material is a quantity that relates the speed of light through that particular material to the speed of light through vacuum.

After this week you can

- discuss and describe electromagnetic waves
- discuss the uses of different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum
- apply the concept of index of refraction
- apply the concept of Doppler shift to electromagnetic waves

Reading this week should include sections 3, 4, 5, and 8 of chapter 22.

## Week 12

### Intro

This week we will look at the first of two interactions of light with materials: reflection and refraction. Reflection of light occurs from light interacting the with surface of a material and being emitted at the same angle that it has entering the surface of that material. For all of these problems we measure the angle of light between the ray of light and the *normal* to the surface, which means the direction perpendicular to the surface. When the surface is flat and smooth, the light reflects in such a way that it appears to come from a mirror image *behind* the mirror. This is known as a *virtual image* since the light is not really diverging from a point behind the mirror, but it appears to from that virtual space. For concave mirrors, it is possible for light to converge to a point and then immediately diverge, which is called a *real image*. This called real, because the energy carried by the light is really present at that location, something you would know for sure if you use light from the sun to focus to a point as is done in many solar power generation farms. As we will see, the distance of this image from the mirror can be determined easily and the size of the image relative to the original object emitting light is related to it.

After this week you can,

- discuss the reflection of light from a surface
- use the law of reflection to solve interesting problems
- discuss image formation from a curved mirror and the concepts of virtual images and real images
- use the mirror equation to find the location of an image

Reading suggestions for this week include sections 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 of chapter 23.

## Week 13

### Intro

This week we will consider another way that light behaves when interacting with a change of medium as it crosses a surface and that is refraction. Refraction is when light travels with a different angle within the material relative to the normal than it did outside of the material. The law that relates the angle of incidence to the angle of transmission between two materials with different indices of refraction is called *Snell's Law*. By changing the geometry of a surface, we can combine refractions in order to change the path of light and either converge diverging light back to a point and form a real image, or cause diverging light to diverge differently thereby changing where that light appears so diverge from (a virtual image). By making thin lenses, the relationship between the objects location, the location where the image is formed and the focal length of the lens is the same as the mirror equation and magnification equation we used last week.

After this week you can

- use Snell's law to solve interesting problems
- survive on a deserted island by knowing how to spear fish under water
- apply the thin lens equation to solve interesting problems
- describe the conditions in order to see a rainbow

Reading for this week should include sections 3, 4, and 9 of chapter 23.

## Week 14

### Intro
This week we will finish off with an application of optics to optical instruments. Many optical instruments depend on a compound series of lenses, so we will investigate how to handle those. In addition, our eyes are an optical instrument in a sense, and we will look at the optics of the eye as well as corrective lenses that aid the eye in proper image formation on the retina.

After this week you can:
- discuss the function of multi-lens systems including the microscope and telescope.
- discuss image formation in an eye and what anatomy controls that
- determine the features of lenses that can be used to aid the eye

Reading suggestions for this week include sections 1, 3, 4, 6 of chapter 25.
